# TrackFiles
Master list of all Track files, including Blender Files, FBX exports, and sketch PNGs.

All active tracks should have their own folder containing subfolders for Blender files, FBX file exports, and sketchs.
Inside each of these folders should be the newest version of the track and a sub-folder containing all old versions.

Blender File Naming Convention: TrackName_VX.Y_Lastcheckpoint.blend
Example: Golisano_V1.3_BankCurves.blend

FBX File Naming Convention: TrackName_VX.fbx
Example: Golisano_V1.fbx

Sketch File Naming Convention: TrackName_VX(_SpecificPart).png/.jpg
Example: Golisano_V1_FirstFloor.png

Misc Greyboxing Models Folder: Store any models made by Level Design to greybox that are not bound to a track.
Prototype Archive Folder: Stores tracks that were not greenlit for safe keeping.
